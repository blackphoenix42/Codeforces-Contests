## üîπ What is a Network?

### ‚úÖ Definition:

A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices (nodes) that communicate and share resources (e.g., data, printers, internet) with each other using predefined communication protocols over transmission media.

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

- Resource sharing
- Communication (email, chat, video calls)
- Remote access and administration
- Centralized data management

---

## üîπ Types of Networks

### ‚úÖ 1. LAN (Local Area Network)

- Small geographical area (home, office)
- High speed
- Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi in a building

### ‚úÖ 2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

- Covers city-sized area
- Higher cost, medium speed
- Example: Cable TV network in a city

### ‚úÖ 3. WAN (Wide Area Network)

- Covers country or continent
- Uses leased telephone lines or satellites
- Example: The Internet

### ‚úÖ 4. PAN (Personal Area Network)

- Short range (~10 meters)
- Used for personal devices
- Example: Bluetooth, USB tethering

---

## üîπ Network Topologies

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**Topology** refers to the physical or logical arrangement of network devices.

### ‚úÖ Types:

1. **Star Topology**

   - All nodes connect to a central hub
   - Easy to manage; hub failure leads to total failure

2. **Bus Topology**

   - All nodes connected to a single backbone
   - Cheap but suffers from collisions

3. **Ring Topology**

   - Devices connected in a circular fashion
   - Token passing used; break in one node affects the whole

4. **Mesh Topology**

   - Every node connected to every other node
   - Expensive but reliable

5. **Hybrid Topology**
   - Combination of two or more topologies

### ‚úÖ Diagram:

```
Star Topology:

## üîπ OSI Model ‚Äì 7 Layers

### ‚úÖ Definition:

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model standardizes the functions of a telecommunication system into **seven layers**, helping different networks communicate reliably.

### ‚úÖ Layers:

| Layer | Name         | Functions                                   |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 7     | Application  | User interface, services like HTTP, SMTP    |
| 6     | Presentation | Data formatting, encryption, compression    |
| 5     | Session      | Establish/manage/end communication sessions |
| 4     | Transport    | Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP), segmentation   |
| 3     | Network      | Routing, IP addressing                      |
| 2     | Data Link    | MAC addressing, error detection             |
| 1     | Physical     | Transmission media, bits, signals           |

## üîπ Encapsulation and Decapsulation

### ‚úÖ Concept:

When data travels **down the OSI model** from sender ‚Üí receiver, it undergoes:

- **Encapsulation:** Each layer adds its own header (and possibly trailer)
- **Decapsulation:** On the receiver side, each layer removes its respective header

### ‚úÖ Example:

```
Sender:
Application Data
‚Üì
[Transport Header] + Application Data ‚Üí Segment
‚Üì
[Network Header] + Segment ‚Üí Packet
‚Üì
[Data Link Header/Trailer] + Packet ‚Üí Frame
‚Üì
Bits ‚Üí Physical Transmission

Receiver:
Bits
‚Üí Frame ‚Üí Packet ‚Üí Segment ‚Üí Data
```

## üîπ Sample Code: Socket Connection (Application Layer)

```cpp
// Simple TCP Client in C++
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    sockaddr_in server;
    server.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server.sin_port = htons(8080);
    inet_pton(AF_INET, "127.0.0.1", &server.sin_addr);

    connect(sock, (struct sockaddr*)&server, sizeof(server));
    send(sock, "Hello Server!", 13, 0);

    char buffer[1024] = {0};
    read(sock, buffer, 1024);
    std::cout << "Server Reply: " << buffer << std::endl;

    close(sock);
    return 0;
}
```

### ‚úÖ Sample Output:

```
Server Reply: Welcome Client!
```

## üîπ Analog vs Digital Signals

### ‚úÖ Definition:

- **Analog Signal:** Continuous in time and value. Can have infinite variations within a range.
- **Digital Signal:** Discrete in time and value. Uses binary (0 and 1).

---

### ‚úÖ Characteristics:

| Feature        | Analog                     | Digital                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Nature         | Continuous                 | Discrete                        |
| Representation | Sine waves                 | Square waves                    |
| Examples       | Sound waves, radio signals | Computer data, Ethernet signals |
| Susceptibility | More prone to noise        | Less susceptible to noise       |

---

### ‚úÖ Diagrams:

```
Analog Signal:
     ~~~~~~~~              ~~~~~~~
   ~          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~       ~~~~~
~                                     ~~~

Digital Signal:
 ____      ______      _______
|    |    |      |    |       |
|____|    |______|    |_______|
```

---

## üîπ Bit Rate vs Baud Rate

### ‚úÖ Definitions:

- **Bit Rate (bps):** Number of bits transmitted per second.
- **Baud Rate:** Number of signal changes (symbols) per second.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Relationship:

```
Bit Rate = Baud Rate √ó log‚ÇÇ(L)
Where L = Number of distinct signal levels.
```

- If each symbol carries 1 bit (binary encoding):  
  `Bit Rate = Baud Rate`
- If each symbol carries multiple bits (e.g., QAM):  
  `Bit Rate > Baud Rate`

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

If a signal has 4 voltage levels, each level represents **2 bits** (log‚ÇÇ4 = 2).  
If baud rate = 1000 baud, then:  
`Bit Rate = 1000 √ó 2 = 2000 bps`

---

### ‚úÖ Real-World Analogy:

- **Baud Rate:** How many times you blink your eye per second.
- **Bit Rate:** How much information is communicated by each blink.

---

### ‚úÖ Interview Q&A:

**Q1:** Why is baud rate lower than bit rate in modern systems?  
**A:** Because we encode multiple bits in one signal level (multi-level modulation like QAM, PSK).

**Q2:** Is it possible to have a high bit rate with low baud rate?  
**A:** Yes, by increasing signal levels (e.g., using 16-QAM, 64-QAM).

---

## üîπ Nyquist & Shannon‚Äôs Theorems

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Nyquist Theorem (Noiseless Channel)

**Formula:**

```
Max Bit Rate = 2 √ó Bandwidth √ó log‚ÇÇ(L)
```

- L = Number of discrete signal levels
- Bandwidth in Hz

**Implication:**  
Higher signal levels ‚Üí Higher data rate  
But limited by hardware and signal distinguishability

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Shannon Capacity (Noisy Channel)

**Formula:**

```
C = B √ó log‚ÇÇ(1 + S/N)
```

Where:

- C = Channel Capacity (bps)
- B = Bandwidth (Hz)
- S/N = Signal-to-noise ratio (unitless)

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

If:

- Bandwidth = 3 kHz
- SNR = 30 dB = 1000 (10^(30/10))

Then:

```
C = 3000 √ó log‚ÇÇ(1 + 1000)
  ‚âà 3000 √ó 9.97
  ‚âà 29910 bps
```

---

### ‚úÖ Diagrams:

```
Shannon Curve (SNR vs Capacity):
Capacity ‚Üë logarithmically as SNR ‚Üë

Nyquist Graph:
Bit Rate ‚Üë linearly with log‚ÇÇ(L) and bandwidth
```

---

### ‚úÖ Real-World Q&A:

**Q1:** What limits real-world transmission speed?  
**A:** Noise, hardware constraints, and channel capacity.

**Q2:** Why can‚Äôt we increase L (levels) infinitely?  
**A:** High L makes signals harder to distinguish, especially in noisy environments.

**Q3:** What‚Äôs more realistic: Nyquist or Shannon?  
**A:** Shannon ‚Äì it accounts for noise, which is always present.

- **Baseband Signal:** The original data signal
- **Modulated Signal:** Final signal after combining carrier + data

---

## üîπ Digital Modulation Techniques

### ‚úÖ 1. Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

#### üìå Concept:

- The **amplitude** of the carrier wave is varied to represent binary data.
- Binary 1 = High amplitude, Binary 0 = Low or no amplitude

#### üß† Characteristics:

- Simple, easy to implement
- Very susceptible to noise (since noise affects amplitude)

#### üìä Diagram:

```
Bitstream:    1   0   1   1   0
ASK Signal:  __      __  __
            |  |    |  ||  |
```

#### üì¶ Use Case:

## üîπ Advanced Forms (Mention Only)

- **QPSK (Quadrature PSK)**: 2 bits per symbol (0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞)
- **QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)**: Combines ASK + PSK
- **BPSK (Binary PSK)**: Simplest form of PSK
- **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)**: Used in 4G/5G

---

## üîπ Real-World Q&A

**Q1:** Why is PSK better than ASK?

- Because PSK is more **noise-resistant**, making it suitable for wireless systems.

**Q2:** Where is FSK commonly used?

- In **Bluetooth**, due to its simplicity and moderate robustness.

**Q3:** Which modulation is used in Wi-Fi?

- **BPSK**, **QPSK**, and **QAM**, depending on speed and signal strength.

**Q4:** Can modulation be used over fiber optics?

- Yes, typically **ASK or QAM-based optical modulation** techniques are used.

# ‚úÖ 3. Data Link Layer ‚Äì Framing & Error Detection

---

## üîπ Framing

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**Framing** is the process of converting a stream of bits into distinguishable units (frames) so that the receiver can interpret boundaries and data correctly.

---

### üß© Techniques of Framing:

#### 1. **Character Count**

- A field in the header specifies the number of characters in the frame.
- ‚ùå Issue: If count gets corrupted, entire frame alignment is lost.

```
[05][Data1][Data2][Data3][Data4][Data5]
```

---

#### 2. **Byte Stuffing (Character-Oriented)**

- Special **flag byte** indicates frame boundaries (e.g., `FLAG = 01111110`)
- If data contains flag byte, insert **escape (ESC)** character before it.

```
Original Data:     FLAG, A, B, ESC, FLAG
Stuffed Frame:     FLAG, A, B, ESC, ESC, ESC, FLAG, FLAG
```

---

#### 3. **Bit Stuffing (Bit-Oriented)**

- After 5 consecutive `1`s in data, insert a `0` to avoid confusion with `flag = 01111110`.

```
Sender Data:       01111110 ‚Üí Data: 0111110
Transmitted:       011111010

Receiver removes the extra 0 after every 5 ones.
```

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why is bit stuffing preferred in HDLC?

- Because HDLC is bit-oriented and flag-based, making bit stuffing a natural choice.

**Q2:** What if a frame delimiter appears in the actual data?

- Use byte/bit stuffing to escape such sequences and preserve frame boundaries.

---

## üîπ Error Detection Techniques

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Parity Bits

#### üìå Concept:

Add an extra bit to make the total number of 1s **even (even parity)** or **odd (odd parity)**.

#### üß™ Example:

- Data: `1011001` ‚Üí Even parity = `10110011`
- Single-bit error detection only

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Checksum

#### üìå Concept:

- Break data into equal segments (e.g., 8 or 16 bits)
- Add all segments, take **1's complement** of the sum
- Send it as checksum

#### ‚úÖ Example (8-bit):

```
Data1 = 01010101
Data2 = 01110010
Sum   = 11000111
Checksum = ~(11000111) = 00111000
```

At receiver:

```
Add Data1 + Data2 + Checksum ‚Üí Should be all 1s (i.e., 11111111)
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)

#### üìå Concept:

- Treat data as a **binary polynomial**
- Divide it by a **generator polynomial (G(x))**
- Append **remainder** (CRC bits) to the data
- Receiver divides the whole message by same G(x); if remainder is 0 ‚Üí no error

#### üî¢ Example:

Data = `1101011011`  
Generator (G) = `10011` (5-bit ‚Üí CRC = 4 bits)

Perform binary division, obtain 4-bit remainder, append to data.

```
Transmitted: 1101011011 + CRC
```

---

### ‚úÖ Comparison Table

| Technique  | Detects       | Correction? | Overhead | Use Case              |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Parity Bit | 1-bit errors  | No          | Low      | Simple hardware links |
| Checksum   | Burst errors  | No          | Medium   | IP, UDP, TCP          |
| CRC        | Multiple bits | No          | High     | Ethernet, HDLC        |

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why isn't checksum enough in Ethernet?

- CRC is more robust for detecting burst and complex errors; hence used in Ethernet.

**Q2:** Can parity detect 2-bit errors?

- ‚ùå No, it only works for **odd number** of bit errors.

**Q3:** What happens if CRC detects an error?

- Frame is discarded; **upper layers (Transport)** handle retransmission (e.g., via TCP).

**Q4:** Is error detection same as error correction?

- No:
  - **Detection:** Know that error occurred
  - **Correction:** Fix the error (e.g., Hamming code)

---

# ‚úÖ 3. Data Link Layer ‚Äì Error Correction, Flow Control, ARQ Protocols

---

## üîπ Error Correction

### ‚úÖ Hamming Code

#### üìå Concept:

**Hamming Code** is a forward error correction technique that can detect and correct **single-bit errors** using redundant parity bits placed at power-of-two positions.

---

### üß† How It Works:

For `k` data bits, we add `r` parity bits such that:

```
2^r ‚â• k + r + 1
```

---

### ‚úÖ Example (4-bit data)

Let‚Äôs encode `1011` using Hamming(7,4):

#### Step 1: Positions (1-based indexing)

```
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Bits:      P P D P D D D
           1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

Let data bits = `D = 1 0 1 1` ‚Üí Positions 3, 5, 6, 7

Insert:

```
3 ‚Üí 1
5 ‚Üí 0
6 ‚Üí 1
7 ‚Üí 1
```

#### Step 2: Calculate parity bits

- **P1 (bit 1)** ‚Üí covers bits 1,3,5,7 ‚Üí 1 ‚äï 1 ‚äï 0 ‚äï 1 = **0**
- **P2 (bit 2)** ‚Üí covers bits 2,3,6,7 ‚Üí 2 ‚äï 1 ‚äï 1 ‚äï 1 = **1**
- **P4 (bit 4)** ‚Üí covers bits 4,5,6,7 ‚Üí 0 ‚äï 0 ‚äï 1 ‚äï 1 = **0**

Final encoded word:

```
Bits: [0 1 1 0 0 1 1]
Index: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

---

### ‚úÖ Error Detection & Correction:

If receiver receives: `0 1 1 0 1 1 1`  
Check parity bits ‚Üí calculate syndrome ‚Üí get error position = `5`  
‚Üí Flip bit 5 to correct.

---

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:

- RAM memory protection
- Satellite communications
- Reliable low-latency systems

---

## üîπ Flow Control

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**Flow control** ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver by sending data too fast.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Stop-and-Wait Protocol

#### üìå Concept:

- Sender sends **one frame** and waits for **ACK** before sending the next.
- Simple but inefficient (low bandwidth utilization).

```
S ‚Üí Frame1 ‚Üí R
S ‚Üê  ACK1  ‚Üê R
S ‚Üí Frame2 ‚Üí R
```

#### üß† Problem:

- Idle time due to round-trip delay.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Sliding Window Protocol

#### üìå Concept:

- Allows multiple frames to be sent before waiting for ACK.
- Sender has a **window size (N)** of outstanding unacknowledged frames.
- Receiver may also buffer out-of-order frames.

#### üîÅ Terms:

- **Window size**: Number of unACKed frames allowed in transit.
- **Sequence numbers**: Wrap-around using modulo arithmetic.

```
Window [0,1,2,3] ‚Üí Send Frame0 ‚Üí Frame3 ‚Üí Wait
ACKs shift window forward
```

---

### ‚úÖ Comparison:

| Protocol       | Efficiency | Complexity | Use Case             |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Stop-and-Wait  | Low        | Simple     | Low-latency channels |
| Sliding Window | High       | Moderate   | High-speed networks  |

---

## üîπ ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) Protocols

### ‚úÖ 1. Stop-and-Wait ARQ

- Sender sends one frame and waits.
- If **timeout**, retransmit.
- Detects error via checksum/CRC.

```
S ‚Üí Frame1 ‚Üí R
S ‚Üê  ACK1   ‚Üê R
(no ACK?) ‚Üí retransmit
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Go-Back-N ARQ

- Sender can send `N` frames before needing ACK.
- If a frame is lost, **all subsequent frames are retransmitted**.

#### Example:

Frame 3 is lost ‚Üí receiver discards frames 4,5  
‚Üí Sender retransmits 3,4,5

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Selective Repeat ARQ

- Sender retransmits **only the lost frame**
- Receiver **buffers** out-of-order frames

#### Example:

Frame 3 lost, but 4,5 received  
‚Üí Receiver stores 4,5  
‚Üí Requests retransmission of 3 only

---

### ‚úÖ Comparison Table:

| ARQ Type         | Window Size | Retransmission   | Buffer at Receiver   | Efficiency |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Stop-and-Wait    | 1           | 1 frame          | None                 | Low        |
| Go-Back-N        | N           | From error frame | Discards future      | Medium     |
| Selective Repeat | N           | Only lost frames | Buffers out-of-order | High       |

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why is sliding window more efficient than stop-and-wait?  
Because it keeps the link busy by allowing multiple outstanding frames.

**Q2:** Why is Selective Repeat rarely used in hardware?  
Because it requires **more buffer** and **complex out-of-order reassembly**.

**Q3:** What happens if ACK is lost?  
Sender waits until timeout, then **retransmits** the frame.

**Q4:** Is ARQ used in TCP?  
Yes, **TCP uses a variant of sliding window with cumulative ACKs and retransmissions**.

# ‚úÖ 3. Data Link Layer ‚Äì MAC Protocols, Ethernet, LAN Types

## üîπ MAC (Media Access Control)

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**MAC** is a sublayer of the Data Link Layer responsible for **controlling how devices access and transmit on a shared medium** to avoid collisions.

---

## üîπ ALOHA Protocols

### ‚úÖ 1. Pure ALOHA

#### üìå Concept:

---

## üîπ CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)

### ‚úÖ Concept:

Listen before transmitting (i.e., **sense the channel**).

---

### ‚úÖ 1. CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)

- Used in **wired Ethernet**
- **Listen** before transmitting
- If collision occurs, **stop transmission** and send a jamming signal
- Wait for a **random backoff time**, then retry

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Works **only in half-duplex wired** medium.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)

- Used in **Wi-Fi / wireless networks**
- Cannot detect collisions (broadcast medium), so it **tries to avoid them**
- Uses **ACK-based confirmation** and **RTS/CTS** (Request to Send / Clear to Send)

---

### ‚úÖ Comparison Table:

| Protocol | Used In  | Detect or Avoid? | Medium Type | Collision Handling |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| CSMA/CD  | Ethernet | Detect           | Wired       | Stop + Backoff     |
| CSMA/CA  | Wi-Fi    | Avoid            | Wireless    | RTS/CTS + ACK      |

# ‚úÖ 4. Network Layer ‚Äì IP Addressing & Concepts

---

## üîπ IP Addressing

### ‚úÖ Definition:

An **IP address** is a **32-bit (IPv4)** or **128-bit (IPv6)** logical identifier for a device on a network. It uniquely identifies the **source and destination** for data transmission.

---

## üîπ IP Address Classes (IPv4)

IPv4 uses **32-bit addressing**, represented as 4 decimal octets (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

### ‚úÖ Address Classes:

| Class | Starting Bits | Range                       | Default Subnet Mask | Usage               |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| A     | 0xxxxxxx      | 1.0.0.0 ‚Äì 126.255.255.255   | 255.0.0.0           | Large networks      |

## üîπ Public vs Private IPs

### ‚úÖ Private IP Ranges:

| Class | Private Range                 |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| A     | 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255     |

| C     | 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255 |

- **Private IPs**: Used within LAN; not routable on the internet.
- **Public IPs**: Globally unique; routable on the internet.

---

## üîπ Subnetting

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**Subnetting** is dividing a large network into smaller **sub-networks (subnets)** by borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address.

---

### ‚úÖ Subnet Mask:

- Defines which part of IP is **network** and which is **host**.
- Example:
  - IP: `192.168.1.10`
  - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0` (24 bits ‚Üí /24)
  - Network Address: `192.168.1.0`
  - Broadcast Address: `192.168.1.255`

---

### ‚úÖ Calculation:

- To create `n` subnets, borrow `x` bits:

  ```
  2^x ‚â• n
  ```

- Number of Hosts per Subnet:
  ```
  2^h - 2 (excluding network & broadcast)
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Divide `192.168.1.0/24` into 4 subnets:

- 4 = 2^2 ‚Üí Borrow 2 bits
- New subnet mask = /26 = 255.255.255.192

Subnets:

- 192.168.1.0 ‚Üí 192.168.1.63
- 192.168.1.64 ‚Üí 192.168.1.127
- 192.168.1.128 ‚Üí 192.168.1.191
- 192.168.1.192 ‚Üí 192.168.1.255

---

## üîπ Supernetting

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**Supernetting** (route aggregation) is combining multiple **smaller networks** into a **larger one** to reduce routing table size.

- Opposite of subnetting
- Common in ISP-level routing

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Combine:

- 192.168.4.0/24
- 192.168.5.0/24
- 192.168.6.0/24
- 192.168.7.0/24

‚Üí Supernet: 192.168.4.0/22

---

## üîπ CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

### ‚úÖ Concept:

- Introduced to **overcome classful limitations** and enable efficient IP allocation.
- IP addresses written as `IP/prefix-length`

  - Example: `192.168.1.0/24`

- Removes class boundaries
- Allows flexible subnetting

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

- Reduces IP wastage
- Supports route summarization
- Used in modern routers and ISPs

---

## üîπ VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)

### ‚úÖ Concept:

- Allows **different subnet masks** for different subnets of the same network.
- Maximizes IP utilization.

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Given: `192.168.10.0/24`, allocate:

- 100 hosts ‚Üí /25 ‚Üí `192.168.10.0 ‚Äì 192.168.10.127`
- 50 hosts ‚Üí /26 ‚Üí `192.168.10.128 ‚Äì 192.168.10.191`
- 25 hosts ‚Üí /27 ‚Üí `192.168.10.192 ‚Äì 192.168.10.223`

---

## üîπ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why is subnetting useful?

- It improves **network performance**, **security**, and **address organization**.

**Q2:** What‚Äôs the difference between CIDR and VLSM?

- CIDR is for **external routing and aggregation**, VLSM is for **internal subnet design**.

**Q3:** Why can't public IPs be reused?

- They're globally routable and must be unique to avoid collisions.

**Q4:** What happens if the subnet mask is misconfigured?

- Devices may not communicate with their intended subnet or gateway.

**Q5:** Why subtract 2 from host count?

- One address is **network**, one is **broadcast** (not assignable to hosts).

# ‚úÖ 4. Network Layer ‚Äì Binary Subnetting, IP Fragmentation, IPv4 vs IPv6

---

## üîπ Binary Math for Subnetting

### ‚úÖ Goal:

Determine network, broadcast, and host ranges using **bitwise operations** on the IP and subnet mask.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Binary Concepts:

- IP and Subnet Mask are **32-bit binary values**
- **Network Address** = IP AND Subnet Mask
- **Broadcast Address** = Network Address OR Inverted Subnet Mask
- Total Hosts = 2^H - 2 (H = number of host bits)

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Given:

- IP = `192.168.1.130`
- Subnet Mask = `255.255.255.192` = `/26`

Convert to binary:

```
IP:         11000000.10101000.00000001.10000010
Subnet:     11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
Network:    11000000.10101000.00000001.10000000 = 192.168.1.128
Broadcast:  11000000.10101000.00000001.10111111 = 192.168.1.191
```

### ‚úÖ Result:

- Network: `192.168.1.128`
- Broadcast: `192.168.1.191`
- Range: `192.168.1.129` ‚Äì `192.168.1.190`
- Hosts: `2^(32‚Äì26) - 2 = 62`

---

## üîπ IP Fragmentation and Reassembly

### ‚úÖ Why Fragment?

- Networks may have different **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)** sizes.
- If a datagram exceeds MTU, it's **fragmented** into smaller packets.

---

### ‚úÖ Fragmentation Fields:

| Field               | Description                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ID                  | Unique identifier for each datagram     |
| Offset              | Position of fragment in original packet |
| MF (More Fragments) | 1 if more fragments follow              |

---

### ‚úÖ Fragmentation Example:

Original IP Packet: 4000 bytes  
MTU = 1500 bytes  
‚Üí IP Header = 20 bytes  
‚Üí Max data per fragment = 1480 bytes

**Fragments:**

- Frag1: Offset = 0, Length = 1480, MF=1
- Frag2: Offset = 1480/8 = 185, Length = 1480, MF=1
- Frag3: Offset = 2960/8 = 370, Length = 1040, MF=0

---

### ‚úÖ Reassembly:

- Performed at **destination only**.
- Fragments reassembled based on **ID, offset**, and **MF** flag.
- If any fragment is missing ‚Üí entire packet is discarded.

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world Notes:

- Fragmentation increases overhead.
- Often avoided using **Path MTU Discovery**.

## üîπ IPv4 vs IPv6

### ‚úÖ Address Format:

| Feature        | IPv4                              | IPv6                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Address Length | 32 bits                           | 128 bits                              |

| Address Space  | ~4.3 billion                      | 3.4 √ó 10^38                           |
| Header Size    | 20 bytes                          | 40 bytes                              |

---

### ‚úÖ Feature Comparison:

| Feature        | IPv4                          | IPv6                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| NAT Support    | Required (due to IP shortage) | Not needed (huge address space)   |
| Broadcast      | Supported                     | Not used (uses multicast instead) |
| Security       | Optional (IPSec)              | Built-in IPSec                    |
| Fragmentation  | Routers & Host                | Only Host                         |
| Configuration  | Manual / DHCP                 | Auto-config (SLAAC) + DHCPv6      |
| Mobility & QoS | Limited                       | Built-in support                  |
| Packet Routing | Less efficient                | Simplified header & routing       |

---

### ‚úÖ IPv6 Address Example:

```
Full:     2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329
Shortened: 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329
```

---

### ‚úÖ Transition Techniques:

- **Dual Stack:** Devices run both IPv4 and IPv6
- **Tunneling:** IPv6 over IPv4 (6to4, ISATAP)
- **Translation:** NAT64

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why is IPv6 adoption slow?

- Legacy infrastructure, cost of transition, compatibility issues.

**Q2:** Can IPv6 solve NAT problems?

- Yes, because it provides **enough public IPs** for every device.

**Q3:** Why was fragmentation moved from routers to hosts in IPv6?

- To reduce **router processing overhead** and improve performance.

**Q4:** Why doesn‚Äôt IPv6 use broadcast?

- **Multicast** and **anycast** are more efficient and scalable.

# ‚úÖ 4. Network Layer ‚Äì Routing Algorithms & Protocols

---

## üîπ Routing

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**Routing** is the process of selecting the best path for a packet to travel from source to destination across interconnected networks.

Routers use **routing tables** and **algorithms** to make decisions.

---

## üîπ Static vs Dynamic Routing

### ‚úÖ Static Routing

- Manually configured by the administrator
- Routes remain fixed unless manually changed
- No overhead due to route recalculations

#### ‚úÖ Pros:

- Simple to implement
- Secure and predictable

#### ‚ùå Cons:

- No fault tolerance
- Not scalable in large networks

---

### ‚úÖ Dynamic Routing

- Routers **exchange information** using routing protocols
- Routing tables are updated automatically
- Supports fault tolerance and scalability

#### ‚úÖ Pros:

- Adapts to network failures
- Easier to manage in large networks

#### ‚ùå Cons:

- Consumes CPU, memory, and bandwidth
- Potential for routing loops and convergence delays

---

## üîπ Distance Vector Routing (RIP)

### ‚úÖ Protocol: **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**

- Type: Distance Vector
- Metric: **Hop Count**
- Max Hop Count: 15 (16 = unreachable)
- Update Interval: Every 30 seconds
- Uses **Bellman-Ford algorithm**

---

### ‚úÖ How it Works:

- Each router sends its **entire routing table** to its neighbors.
- Neighbors update their tables by **adding one hop** to each entry.

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Router A:

```
Dest  | Hops
------|-----
Net1  | 0
Net2  | 1
```

Sends table to B ‚Üí B updates Net1 to 1 hop, Net2 to 2 hops.

---

### ‚úÖ Problems:

- **Count-to-Infinity Problem**
- **Routing Loops**

---

### ‚úÖ Solutions:

- Split Horizon
- Route Poisoning
- Hold-down timers

---

## üîπ Link State Routing (OSPF)

### ‚úÖ Protocol: **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**

- Type: Link State
- Metric: **Cost (Bandwidth)**
- Algorithm: **Dijkstra‚Äôs Shortest Path First**
- Updates: Only when topology changes
- Divides network into **areas** (e.g., Area 0 ‚Äì backbone)

---

### ‚úÖ How it Works:

1. Each router discovers its neighbors.
2. Sends **Link State Advertisements (LSAs)**.
3. Builds a complete **topology map**.
4. Runs Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest paths.

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

- Faster convergence
- More scalable than RIP
- Loop-free by design

---

### ‚úÖ OSPF Packet Types:

| Type           | Purpose              |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Hello          | Discover neighbors   |
| DB Description | Summarize database   |
| LSR            | Request missing LSAs |
| LSU            | Update LSAs          |
| LSAck          | Acknowledge receipt  |

---

## üîπ Path Vector Routing (BGP)

### ‚úÖ Protocol: **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**

- Type: Path Vector
- Used for **inter-domain routing** (between ASes)
- Backbone of the **Internet**
- Metric: **AS Path (list of autonomous systems)**

---

### ‚úÖ How it Works:

- Each BGP router advertises **entire path (AS numbers)** to reach a destination.
- Loop prevention by checking if its own AS appears in the path.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Concepts:

| Term                   | Description                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| AS (Autonomous System) | A group of IP networks under one admin |
| IBGP                   | Internal BGP (within AS)               |
| EBGP                   | External BGP (between ASes)            |
| Policy-Based           | Admin can apply filters & preferences  |

---

### ‚úÖ BGP Attributes:

- AS_PATH
- NEXT_HOP
- LOCAL_PREF
- MED (Multi Exit Discriminator)

---

### ‚úÖ BGP vs OSPF vs RIP

| Feature     | RIP             | OSPF                | BGP              |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Type        | Distance Vector | Link State          | Path Vector      |
| Metric      | Hop Count       | Cost (bandwidth)    | AS Path          |
| Max Hop     | 15              | No Limit            | No Limit         |
| Usage       | Small LANs      | Enterprise Networks | Internet Routing |
| Algorithm   | Bellman-Ford    | Dijkstra            | Path vector      |
| Update Type | Periodic        | Triggered           | Triggered        |

---

## üîπ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why is RIP not suitable for large networks?

- Limited hop count (15), slow convergence, and no support for complex topologies.

**Q2:** Why is OSPF preferred in enterprise networks?

- Fast convergence, support for hierarchy (areas), and efficient routing.

**Q3:** Why does the Internet use BGP?

- BGP supports **policy-based routing**, scalability, and **AS-level control** over routing.

**Q4:** Can a router run OSPF and BGP together?

- Yes. Enterprise routers often use **OSPF internally** and **BGP externally**.

**Q5:** What prevents loops in BGP?

- **AS-PATH checking** ‚Äì a router discards routes containing its own AS number.

---

# ‚úÖ 4. Network Layer ‚Äì Routing Algorithms & Address Resolution

---

## üîπ Routing Algorithms

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm (Link State Routing)

#### üìå Concept:

- Used in **Link State Routing** (e.g., OSPF)
- Computes the **shortest path** from a source node to all other nodes in the network using **weights/costs**.

---

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. Initialize distances from source to all nodes as ‚àû, except source = 0
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited
3. Pick unvisited node with smallest tentative distance
4. Update distance for neighbors
5. Repeat until all nodes are visited

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Graph:

```
A --1-- B --2-- C
|       |
4       3
|       |
D ----- E
```

- Source: A
- Shortest paths: A-B (1), A-D (4), A-E (4), A-C (3)

---

### ‚úÖ Complexity:

- O(V¬≤) for simple
- O((V+E)logV) with min-priority queue (Dijkstra + Heap)

---

### ‚úÖ Used in:

- OSPF
- IS-IS

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Distance Vector Routing)

#### üìå Concept:

- Used in **Distance Vector Routing** (e.g., RIP)
- Each node knows **only distance to neighbors**
- Periodically exchanges distance vectors

---

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. Initialize all distances to ‚àû, source = 0
2. Repeat V-1 times:
   - For each edge (u,v), update:
     ```
     if dist[u] + weight(u,v) < dist[v] then update
     ```

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Node A learns from B that it can reach C in 2 hops  
‚Üí A updates its route to C as `dist[B] + 1`

---

### ‚úÖ Complexity:

- O(V √ó E)

---

### ‚úÖ Problems:

- **Slow convergence**
- **Routing loops**
- **Count-to-Infinity**

---

## üîπ Count-to-Infinity Problem

### ‚úÖ Concept:

- In DVR, a bad route can keep increasing its cost indefinitely due to **slow propagation of "bad news"**

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

- A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C
- C goes down
- B doesn't know yet, tells A it can still reach C
- A updates route through B
- B updates through A... loop continues

---

### ‚úÖ Solutions:

---

### ‚úÖ Split Horizon

- Don‚Äôt advertise a route **back** to the router from which it was learned.

```
If A learned route to C from B ‚Üí A does NOT tell B about it.
```

---

### ‚úÖ Poison Reverse

- Advertise route **with infinite metric** back to the sender to indicate it's no longer valid.

```
A tells B: "My distance to C = ‚àû"
```

---

## üîπ Address Resolution

---

### ‚úÖ ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

#### üìå Purpose:

- Resolve **IP address ‚Üí MAC address** in a local network.

---

### ‚úÖ Working:

1. Host wants to send packet to IP `192.168.1.5`
2. Sends **ARP Request**: "Who has 192.168.1.5?"
3. Target replies with its MAC address
4. Host caches the mapping

---

### ‚úÖ Packet Format:

- Sender MAC, Sender IP
- Target IP, Target MAC (unknown in request)

---

### ‚úÖ ARP Table:

Stored in OS for quick lookup

```
192.168.1.5 ‚Üí 00:14:22:01:23:45
```

---

### ‚úÖ Types:

- **Gratuitous ARP**: Sent to update neighbors (e.g., after IP change)
- **Proxy ARP**: Router replies on behalf of other devices

---

### ‚úÖ Security Issues:

- ARP spoofing ‚Üí Man-in-the-middle attacks

---

### ‚úÖ Command:

```bash
$ arp -a
```

---

### ‚úÖ RARP (Reverse ARP)

#### üìå Purpose:

- Resolve **MAC address ‚Üí IP address**
- Used by **diskless machines** during boot

---

### ‚úÖ Working:

1. Device knows only its MAC
2. Sends RARP request: "This is my MAC, what is my IP?"
3. RARP server replies with IP

---

### ‚úÖ Obsolete:

- Replaced by **BOOTP** and **DHCP**

---

## üîπ Real-world Q&A

**Q1:** Why does RIP suffer from slow convergence?

- Uses periodic updates + no full topology knowledge ‚Üí delay in detecting failures

**Q2:** What‚Äôs the benefit of Dijkstra over Bellman-Ford?

- Dijkstra has **faster convergence** and is **loop-free**

**Q3:** Why is ARP needed if IP already identifies a host?

- IP is logical; for data link layer delivery, **MAC is required**

**Q4:** Is RARP used today?

- No, it's deprecated in favor of **BOOTP** and **DHCP**, which are more flexible

**Q5:** Why does split horizon prevent loops?

- It stops incorrect reverse advertisements, reducing the chance of misinformed updates

---

## üîπ ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

ICMP is used for **diagnostics and error reporting** in IP networks.

- Defined in RFC 792
- Works alongside IP (not TCP/UDP)
- Used by tools like `ping` and `traceroute`

---

### ‚úÖ Common ICMP Message Types:

| Type | Name                    | Use Case                         |
| ---- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0    | Echo Reply              | Ping response                    |
| 3    | Destination Unreachable | No route, port unreachable, etc. |
| 5    | Redirect                | Suggest alternate gateway        |
| 8    | Echo Request            | Ping request                     |
| 11   | Time Exceeded           | Used in Traceroute               |

---

### ‚úÖ Ping

#### üìå How it Works:

1. Sends ICMP Echo Request
2. Awaits ICMP Echo Reply
3. Measures **round-trip time (RTT)**

```bash
$ ping google.com

PING google.com (142.250.183.206): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 142.250.183.206: icmp_seq=0 ttl=117 time=22.5 ms
```

---

### ‚úÖ Traceroute

#### üìå How it Works:

- Sends packets with **increasing TTL** values
- Each hop returns **ICMP Time Exceeded**
- Reveals the **path** a packet takes

```bash
$ traceroute google.com

1  router.local (192.168.1.1)  1.2 ms
2  isp.gateway (10.0.0.1)      10.5 ms
3  ...
```

---

## üîπ NAT (Network Address Translation)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

NAT allows **multiple devices** on a private network to share **one public IP** when accessing the internet.

- Defined in RFC 3022
- Operates at the **router boundary** between LAN and WAN

---

### ‚úÖ Types of NAT:

| Type                           | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Static NAT                     | One-to-one mapping between private and public IP |
| Dynamic NAT                    | Maps private IPs to any available public IP      |
| PAT (Port Address Translation) | Many-to-one using ports                          |

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Internal Device: `192.168.1.10:4321`  
NAT Router maps to: `203.0.113.5:12345`  
External server replies to NAT's public IP + port ‚Üí NAT forwards to original host.

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

- Conserves IPv4 addresses
- Adds basic security by **masking internal IPs**

---

### ‚úÖ Limitations:

- Breaks end-to-end transparency
- Some protocols (like VoIP, FTP) need NAT traversal (e.g., STUN, TURN)

---

## üîπ DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

DHCP automatically assigns **IP addresses and configuration parameters** to devices on a network.

- Defined in RFC 2131
- Replaces older BOOTP
- Uses **UDP (Ports 67 for server, 68 for client)**

---

### ‚úÖ DHCP Process (DORA):

| Step     | Description                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| Discover | Client broadcasts DHCPDISCOVER |
| Offer    | Server replies with DHCPOFFER  |
| Request  | Client sends DHCPREQUEST       |
| Ack      | Server sends DHCPACK           |

---

### ‚úÖ What DHCP Assigns:

- IP address
- Subnet mask
- Gateway
- DNS servers
- Lease time

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

```bash
$ ipconfig /all
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.20
DHCP Server . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1
Lease Obtained. . . . . . . . . . : Monday, July 22
```

---

## üîπ BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

- Older protocol used to assign **IP address and boot file** to diskless clients.

---

### ‚úÖ Differences: BOOTP vs DHCP

| Feature        | BOOTP               | DHCP                          |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Static/Dynamic | Mostly static       | Fully dynamic                 |
| Lease Time     | No lease, permanent | Has lease expiration          |
| Extensions     | Not extensible      | Supports extensions (options) |
| Popularity     | Legacy (obsolete)   | Widely used                   |

---

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:

- BOOTP: Legacy devices, embedded systems
- DHCP: Modern LAN/Wi-Fi setups

---

## üîπ Real-world Q&A

**Q1:** Why does NAT break peer-to-peer apps?

- NAT hides internal IPs ‚Üí direct incoming connections are blocked unless port forwarding is used.

**Q2:** Can ICMP be blocked by firewalls?

- Yes, often **ping/traceroute** fail due to ICMP filtering.

**Q3:** What happens if two devices have the same DHCP IP?

- A conflict occurs ‚Üí one may get disconnected or auto-assigned a link-local IP (169.x.x.x)

**Q4:** Can a device have static IP with DHCP running?

- Yes, but IP must be outside DHCP range or conflicts may occur.

**Q5:** Why does traceroute show `* * *` sometimes?

- Routers may be configured to **not respond to ICMP TTL expired** messages.

---

# ‚úÖ 5. Transport Layer ‚Äì Core Concepts

---

## üîπ Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

### ‚úÖ Definition:

- **Multiplexing**: Combining data from multiple application processes at the sender and sending them through a single transport layer connection.
- **Demultiplexing**: Delivering received segments to the correct receiving application process at the receiver.

---

### ‚úÖ Real Example:

- You have a web browser (HTTP) and a mail client (SMTP) running simultaneously.
- Both use the **same IP address**, but different **port numbers**.
- The transport layer uses port numbers to ensure correct delivery.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Point:

- **Transport Layer** uses **port numbers** to **identify different applications** (processes).

---

## üîπ Process-to-Process Communication

### ‚úÖ Concept:

Unlike the network layer (which does **host-to-host** delivery), the transport layer provides **process-to-process** delivery (application-level communication).

---

### ‚úÖ Analogy:

- IP = Apartment address (host)
- Port = Room number (process)

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

A client sends HTTP request:

- IP = `172.217.167.142` (google.com)
- Port = 80 (HTTP)

The server replies:

- To client IP + random ephemeral port (e.g., 49152)

---

## üîπ Ports and Sockets

### ‚úÖ Ports

- **Port = 16-bit number** used to identify a specific process/application on a host
- Ranges:
  - **0‚Äì1023**: Well-known ports (HTTP=80, FTP=21, DNS=53)
  - **1024‚Äì49151**: Registered ports
  - **49152‚Äì65535**: Ephemeral/private ports

---

### ‚úÖ Sockets

- A **socket** is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on a network.
- Identified by **<IP, Port>** pair

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Client Socket: `192.168.1.10:49152`  
Server Socket: `172.217.167.142:80`

Connection: from Client Socket ‚Üí Server Socket

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why are ephemeral ports used?

- To allow multiple simultaneous client connections without conflict.

**Q2:** What happens if two apps try to use the same port?

- OS prevents it; port already in use error occurs.

---

## üîπ UDP vs TCP

---

### ‚úÖ UDP ‚Äì User Datagram Protocol

| Header Size     | 20‚Äì60 bytes                                  |
| Flow Control    | Sliding window                               |
| Use Cases       | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH                         |

---

### ‚úÖ TCP Features:

- **Three-way Handshake**: SYN ‚Üí SYN-ACK ‚Üí ACK
- **Reliable Transmission**: Lost packets are retransmitted
- **Ordered Delivery**: Segments are sequenced
- **Flow Control**: Receiver window size
- **Congestion Control**: Avoids overwhelming network

---

### ‚úÖ UDP Features:

- **No connection establishment**
- **No sequencing or retransmission**
- Lightweight and faster

---

### ‚úÖ Comparison Table:

| Feature            | TCP                   | UDP                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Connection         | Yes (3-way handshake) | No                    |
| Reliability        | Reliable, ordered     | Unreliable, unordered |

### ‚úÖ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why is TCP used for web traffic?

- Reliable and ordered delivery ensures correct rendering of web pages.

**Q2:** Can video calls use TCP?

- They can, but usually use UDP for lower latency despite potential loss.

**Q3:** What happens if a UDP packet is lost?

- It‚Äôs discarded. No retransmission by the protocol.

**Q4:** Is UDP always faster than TCP?

- Yes in setup and per-packet overhead, but **can be slower** if packet loss requires app-level retransmission.

## üîπ TCP ‚Äì Transmission Control Protocol

### ‚úÖ Overview:

TCP is a **connection-oriented**, **reliable**, **full-duplex**, and **byte-stream-based** transport protocol. It ensures:

- Reliable delivery
- Ordered delivery
- Congestion control
- Flow control

---

## üîπ 3-Way Handshake (Connection Establishment)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Establishes a reliable connection between client and server by **synchronizing sequence numbers** and acknowledging readiness.

---

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. **SYN**: Client ‚Üí Server  
   Sends a TCP segment with `SYN=1`, `seq=x`

2. **SYN-ACK**: Server ‚Üí Client  
   Responds with `SYN=1`, `ACK=1`, `seq=y`, `ack=x+1`

3. **ACK**: Client ‚Üí Server  
   Sends `ACK=1`, `seq=x+1`, `ack=y+1`

---

### ‚úÖ Diagram:

```
Client                             Server
  | ---------- SYN (seq=x) --------> |
  | <------- SYN+ACK (seq=y,ack=x+1)|
  | ----------- ACK (ack=y+1) -----> |
  |----------- CONNECTION ESTABLISHED -----------|
```

---

## üîπ 4-Way Termination (Connection Teardown)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Gracefully closes the TCP connection in both directions.

---

### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. **FIN from Client**: Client ‚Üí Server  
   Requests to terminate (half-close)

2. **ACK from Server**: Server ‚Üí Client  
   Acknowledges client‚Äôs FIN

3. **FIN from Server**: Server ‚Üí Client  
   Server now ready to close

4. **ACK from Client**: Client ‚Üí Server  
   Final ACK to complete termination

---

### ‚úÖ Diagram:

```
Client                             Server
  | ----------- FIN -------------> |
  | <----------- ACK ------------- |
  | <----------- FIN ------------- |
  | ----------- ACK -------------> |
  |--------- CONNECTION CLOSED ------------|
```

---

### ‚úÖ TIME_WAIT State:

- After sending final ACK, the client enters **TIME_WAIT** state for 2√óMSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime) to ensure no delayed packets are misinterpreted.

---

## üîπ TCP Header Fields

### ‚úÖ Size: 20‚Äì60 bytes (without options: 20 bytes)

| Field                 | Size     | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Source Port           | 16 bits  | Sender's port number                          |
| Destination Port      | 16 bits  | Receiver's port number                        |
| Sequence Number       | 32 bits  | Byte offset of the first byte in this segment |
| Acknowledgment Number | 32 bits  | Next byte expected by the receiver            |
| Data Offset           | 4 bits   | Header length                                 |
| Reserved              | 3 bits   | Reserved for future use                       |
| Flags                 | 9 bits   | Control bits (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, PSH, URG)   |
| Window Size           | 16 bits  | Receiver's available buffer size              |
| Checksum              | 16 bits  | Error checking                                |
| Urgent Pointer        | 16 bits  | Used if URG flag is set                       |
| Options (Optional)    | Variable | E.g., for MSS, SACK, timestamps               |

---

### ‚úÖ Key TCP Flags:

| Flag | Description                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| SYN  | Synchronize sequence numbers (start) |
| ACK  | Acknowledgment field valid           |
| FIN  | Finish (terminate connection)        |
| RST  | Reset connection                     |
| PSH  | Push buffered data to application    |
| URG  | Urgent pointer field significant     |

---

### ‚úÖ Example TCP Segment:

```
Source Port: 12345
Dest Port: 80
Seq: 1000
Ack: 0
Flags: SYN
Window: 65535
```

This is the first segment in a 3-way handshake from client.

---

## üîπ Real-world Q&A:

**Q1:** Why is 4 steps needed for termination, not 3 like handshake?

- Because TCP is **full-duplex**, each side must independently close its direction of communication.

**Q2:** What happens during TIME_WAIT?

- Prevents duplicate delayed packets from reappearing in a new connection.

**Q3:** What is MSS in TCP options?

- Maximum Segment Size ‚Äì negotiated during handshake to avoid fragmentation.

**Q4:** Why use sequence numbers in TCP?

- To ensure **ordered delivery** and **detect packet loss or duplication**.

**Q5:** What‚Äôs the purpose of window size?

- Supports **flow control** by informing sender of receiver‚Äôs buffer availability.

---

# ‚úÖ 5. Transport Layer ‚Äì TCP Internals (Part 2)

---

## üîπ Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers

### ‚úÖ Sequence Number

- Specifies the **byte number** of the first byte in the current segment.
- Ensures **ordered delivery** and **tracking of lost packets**.

---

### ‚úÖ Acknowledgment Number

- Specifies the **next expected byte** from the sender.
- Implies: "I‚Äôve received all bytes up to `ack-1`"

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

If a client sends a segment with:

- `SEQ = 1000` and `LEN = 500`

Then the receiver sends:

- `ACK = 1500` (expecting next byte)

---

### ‚úÖ Use Case in 3-Way Handshake:

- Client sends SYN with `SEQ = x`
- Server responds with `SEQ = y`, `ACK = x+1`
- Client replies with `ACK = y+1`

---

## üîπ Congestion Control

TCP uses **congestion control** to avoid overwhelming the network. It adjusts the **congestion window (cwnd)** based on network feedback.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Slow Start

- Starts with small `cwnd` (e.g., 1 MSS)
- For every ACK received, **cwnd doubles** (exponential growth)
- Continues until **threshold** (ssthresh) is reached

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Congestion Avoidance (AIMD)

- After reaching `ssthresh`, growth becomes **linear**
  - `cwnd = cwnd + MSS` per RTT
- Balances performance and congestion safety

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Fast Retransmit

- On receiving **3 duplicate ACKs**, sender assumes packet loss
- Retransmits lost segment **without waiting for timeout**

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Fast Recovery

- After fast retransmit, instead of going to slow start:
  - **ssthresh = cwnd / 2**
  - **cwnd = ssthresh**
  - Resume from congestion avoidance phase

---

### ‚úÖ State Diagram:

```
[Slow Start] ‚Üí (cwnd ‚â• ssthresh) ‚Üí [Congestion Avoidance]
      ‚Üë                              ‚Üì
     Loss (Timeout)         3 Duplicate ACKs
      ‚Üë                              ‚Üì
   Reset cwnd                     [Fast Retransmit + Recovery]
```

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world Q&A:

**Q:** Why not always use large `cwnd`?

- Large window can overload routers ‚Üí **packet drops**, reduced throughput

---

## üîπ Flow Control using Sliding Window

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Ensure sender does not **overwhelm receiver‚Äôs buffer**

---

### ‚úÖ Mechanism:

- Receiver advertises a **window size (rwnd)** in each ACK
- Sender can only send `min(cwnd, rwnd)` worth of unACKed data

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

```
rwnd = 4096 bytes
cwnd = 3000 bytes

‚Üí Sender can send 3000 bytes without ACK
```

---

### ‚úÖ Window Update:

Receiver increases window as it processes more data, allowing sender to resume transmission.

---

### ‚úÖ Silly Window Syndrome:

- Caused by sending very small segments due to small advertised windows.
- Solved by:
  - **Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm**
  - Delayed ACKs
  - Avoiding sending until window has sufficient space

---

## üîπ RTT Estimation & Karn‚Äôs Algorithm

### ‚úÖ RTT (Round Trip Time):

- Time between sending a segment and receiving ACK
- Used to set **Retransmission Timeout (RTO)**

---

### ‚úÖ Estimation Formula (RFC 6298):

```
EstimatedRTT = (1 - Œ±) * EstimatedRTT + Œ± * SampleRTT
DevRTT = (1 - Œ≤) * DevRTT + Œ≤ * |SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT|
RTO = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT

Typical values: Œ± = 0.125, Œ≤ = 0.25
```

---

### ‚úÖ Karn‚Äôs Algorithm

- **Problem:** Can‚Äôt accurately estimate RTT for retransmitted segments (ACK might be for first or second copy)

- **Solution:**
  - **Ignore** RTT samples for retransmitted segments
  - **Double RTO** on timeout (exponential backoff)

---

### ‚úÖ Real-world Q&A

**Q1:** Why is ACK number always `SEQ+LEN`?

- Because TCP is byte-oriented; ACK represents **next byte expected**

**Q2:** What happens if RTT is underestimated?

- Premature retransmissions ‚Üí **network congestion**

**Q3:** Why use exponential backoff for RTO?

- To avoid flooding the network with retries when congestion is severe

**Q4:** Can sender send unlimited data if no congestion?

- No, limited by both **rwnd (receiver buffer)** and **cwnd (network capacity)**

---

# ‚úÖ 5. Transport Layer ‚Äì UDP, Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm, Silly Window Syndrome

---

## üîπ UDP ‚Äì User Datagram Protocol

### ‚úÖ Overview:

UDP is a **connectionless**, **unreliable**, and **lightweight** transport protocol defined in **RFC 768**.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Characteristics:

| Feature                 | Description                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Connection              | **Connectionless** (no handshake) |
| Reliability             | No delivery guarantee             |
| Ordering                | No sequencing or reordering       |
| Flow/Congestion Control | None                              |
| Header Size             | **8 bytes**                       |
| Speed                   | Very fast and low latency         |

---

### ‚úÖ UDP Header Format (8 bytes total):

| Field            | Size    |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Source Port      | 16 bits |
| Destination Port | 16 bits |
| Length           | 16 bits |
| Checksum         | 16 bits |

---

### ‚úÖ UDP Applications:

#### ‚úÖ DNS (Domain Name System)

- Quick query-response model
- Typically uses UDP port **53**
- Retries using TCP only if needed (e.g., large response)

#### ‚úÖ VoIP (Voice over IP)

- Tolerates minor loss, prefers **low latency**
- Dropped packets are better than delayed packets

#### ‚úÖ Video Streaming / Gaming

- Real-time requirements
- Uses **application-layer logic** to handle packet loss, buffering

---

### ‚úÖ Pros of UDP:

- Minimal overhead
- Works well for **broadcasting/multicasting**
- Excellent for time-sensitive applications

---

### ‚úÖ Cons:

- No guarantee of delivery
- No flow or congestion control
- Requires extra application-layer logic for reliability (if needed)

---

## üîπ Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

To **reduce the number of small packets** (a.k.a. "tinygrams") sent over the network and improve **network efficiency**.

- Defined in **RFC 896**
- Used in **TCP only**

---

### ‚úÖ How It Works:

- Send the **first segment** immediately
- Then, **buffer** small segments **until previous ACK is received**
- Coalesces small messages into larger ones

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

Typing characters in Telnet:

- Without Nagle: One TCP segment per keystroke
- With Nagle: Combines multiple keystrokes into one packet

---

### ‚úÖ When to Disable:

- In real-time apps like gaming or live chat
- Use TCP_NODELAY flag to disable Nagle

---

### ‚úÖ Q&A:

**Q:** What happens if both sender and receiver use delayed ACK + Nagle?  
**A:** Can cause deadlock or high latency (known as **"ACK delay + Nagle interaction problem"**)

---

## üîπ Silly Window Syndrome (SWS)

### ‚úÖ Problem:

Occurs when sender or receiver transmits **very small segments** due to **small window size**, leading to **inefficient bandwidth usage**.

---

### ‚úÖ Causes:

- **Sender-side SWS:** Sender keeps sending 1-byte packets
- **Receiver-side SWS:** Receiver advertises window size in very small increments

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

- App generates 1 byte every few milliseconds
- TCP sends each byte as its own packet ‚Üí waste of header space

---

### ‚úÖ Solutions:

#### ‚úÖ At Sender:

- Use **Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm**: Buffer small data until ACK is received

#### ‚úÖ At Receiver:

- Use **receiver-side flow control policy**:
  - Don‚Äôt advertise small window sizes
  - Wait for a threshold before updating window

#### ‚úÖ App Layer:

- Accumulate data before writing to socket

---

### ‚úÖ Comparison: Nagle vs SWS

| Feature       | Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm                 | Silly Window Syndrome             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Side Affected | Sender                            | Both sender & receiver            |
| Purpose       | Reduce small segment transmission | Prevent inefficient small windows |
| Solution For  | TCP overhead                      | Poor flow control                 |

---

## üîπ Real-world Q&A

**Q1:** Why isn‚Äôt UDP used for file transfers?

- No reliability or sequencing ‚Üí unsuitable for lossless delivery

**Q2:** Can Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm improve performance in HTTP?

- Yes, for bulk transfers; but in HTTP/2 or latency-critical cases, it‚Äôs usually disabled

**Q3:** What does `TCP_NODELAY` do?

- Disables Nagle‚Äôs Algorithm; sends packets immediately

**Q4:** Can SWS occur even with large bandwidth?

- Yes, if app sends/receives in tiny chunks, SWS still wastes network resources

---

# ‚úÖ 6. Application Layer ‚Äì DNS & HTTP/HTTPS

---

## üîπ DNS (Domain Name System)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

DNS translates **human-readable domain names** (e.g., google.com) into **IP addresses** (e.g., 142.250.68.14).

---

### ‚úÖ How It Works:

1. **Browser cache** check
2. **OS cache**
3. **DNS Resolver** query
4. Resolver contacts:
   - **Root DNS server**
   - **TLD server** (e.g., `.com`)
   - **Authoritative DNS server**
5. Final IP is returned and cached

---

### ‚úÖ DNS Record Types:

| Type  | Description                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| A     | Maps hostname to IPv4 address |
| AAAA  | Maps hostname to IPv6 address |
| CNAME | Canonical name (alias)        |
| MX    | Mail server                   |
| NS    | Authoritative name server     |
| PTR   | Reverse DNS                   |
| TXT   | Human-readable text           |

---

### ‚úÖ Example Query:

```bash
$ nslookup google.com
Name:    google.com
Address: 142.250.183.238
```

---

### ‚úÖ Example:

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```

---

## üîπ Persistent vs Non-Persistent Connections

### ‚úÖ Non-Persistent (HTTP/1.0):

- **1 TCP connection per object**
- Inefficient for modern web (many resources per page)

---

### ‚úÖ Persistent (HTTP/1.1+):

- **One TCP connection reused** for multiple requests/responses
- Uses `Connection: keep-alive`

---

## üîπ HTTP Versions

---

### ‚úÖ HTTP/1.1

- Default persistent connections
- Pipelining supported (but rarely used)
- **Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking**

---

### ‚úÖ HTTP/2

- **Binary framing layer**
- **Multiplexed streams** on a single TCP connection
- Header compression (HPACK)
- Still vulnerable to **HOL blocking** at TCP level

---

### ‚úÖ HTTP/3

# ‚úÖ 7. Congestion Control & Quality of Service (QoS)

---

## üîπ Congestion vs Flow Control

### ‚úÖ Congestion Control

- A **network-wide** mechanism to prevent **too much traffic** from degrading performance.
- Managed at **transport/network layer**
- Aims to prevent **buffer overflows**, **packet drops**, and **increased latency** in routers/switches.

---

### ‚úÖ Flow Control

- A **sender-receiver mechanism** to ensure the **sender does not overwhelm the receiver's buffer**.
- Managed at **transport layer (e.g., TCP sliding window)**
- Deals with **end-to-end communication**, not intermediate devices.

---

### ‚úÖ Comparison Table:

| Feature        | Flow Control           | Congestion Control                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Scope          | End-to-end             | Entire network                          |
| Trigger        | Receiver's buffer size | Network congestion (e.g., router queue) |
| Protocol Layer | Transport              | Transport/Network                       |
| Examples       | TCP sliding window     | TCP congestion window, ECN              |

---

## üîπ Leaky Bucket Algorithm

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Provides a **constant rate output** regardless of bursty input. It smoothens traffic and prevents congestion.

---

### ‚úÖ Working:

- Uses a **bucket (queue)** to store incoming packets.
- Packets are **removed at a fixed rate**.
- If bucket overflows ‚Üí **packets are dropped**.

---

### ‚úÖ Analogy:

- Imagine pouring water (packets) into a bucket with a hole.
- Water leaks at constant rate.
- If poured too fast ‚Üí overflow (packet drop).

---

### ‚úÖ Diagram (Conceptual):

```
[Incoming Packets] ---> [Bucket] ---> [Fixed Rate Outflow]
                          |
                          ‚Üì
                    Drop if full
```

---

### ‚úÖ Pros:

- Simple and effective in **traffic shaping**
- Enforces **rate limiting**

---

### ‚úÖ Cons:

- Does **not allow bursts**, even when network is idle

---

## üîπ Token Bucket Algorithm

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Allows **controlled bursts** while maintaining average rate. Common in **modern traffic shaping** and **QoS systems**.

---

### ‚úÖ Working:

- Tokens are added to a **bucket at fixed rate**
- Each packet requires a token to be transmitted
- If enough tokens ‚Üí send burst
- If not enough ‚Üí wait (or drop)

---

### ‚úÖ Analogy:

- Bucket holds tokens (permissions to send)
- If tokens exist, data can go through
- Tokens accumulate when idle ‚Üí burst allowed later

---

### ‚úÖ Diagram (Conceptual):

```
[Token Generator] --> [Token Bucket]
      |                      |
[Packets Arrive] --------> [Send if token available]
                              ‚Üì
                        Wait or drop if no token
```

---

### ‚úÖ Pros:

- **Supports bursts**
- Enforces average rate over time
- More flexible than leaky bucket

---

### ‚úÖ Comparison Table:

| Feature       | Leaky Bucket          | Token Bucket                |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Output Rate   | Constant              | Variable (bursty allowed)   |
| Token Concept | No                    | Yes                         |
| Drop Policy   | Drop when bucket full | Wait or drop if no token    |
| Use Case      | Traffic smoothing     | Traffic shaping with bursts |

---

## üîπ Real-world Q&A

**Q1:** Why do we need congestion control in TCP?

**Q2:** Why is token bucket better for real-time applications?

- Allows bursts (e.g., video/audio packets) while maintaining rate limits.

**Q3:** Can you use both leaky and token bucket together?

- Yes. Token bucket for shaping + leaky bucket for smoothing output.

**Q4:** Which one is better for strict bandwidth limiting?

- **Leaky bucket** ‚Äì ensures steady output rate.

**Q5:** Does flow control prevent congestion?

- **No**, it only ensures the receiver is not overloaded, not the network.

---

# ‚úÖ 7. Congestion Control & Quality of Service (QoS) ‚Äì Part 2

---

## üîπ QoS Metrics

**Quality of Service (QoS)** defines the overall performance of a network, particularly in terms of predictable delivery and performance for specific traffic types.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Bandwidth

- Maximum rate of data transfer over a network path.
- Measured in **bps (bits per second)**.
- Higher bandwidth = more simultaneous traffic.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Delay (Latency)

- Time taken for a packet to travel from source to destination.
- Includes:
  - **Processing delay**
  - **Queueing delay**
  - **Transmission delay**
  - **Propagation delay**

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Jitter

- Variation in delay of received packets.
- Critical in **real-time applications** like VoIP, video conferencing.
- High jitter = choppy audio/video.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Packet Loss

- Packets dropped due to:
  - Congestion
  - Buffer overflow
  - Corruption or timeout
- Leads to retransmissions, reduced throughput

---

### ‚úÖ Summary Table:

| Metric      | Unit      | Affects         | Importance In                    |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Bandwidth   | Mbps/Gbps | Speed           | All traffic                      |
| Delay       | ms        | Responsiveness  | Gaming, VoIP                     |
| Jitter      | ms        | Smooth playback | VoIP, video streaming            |
| Packet Loss | %         | Reliability     | TCP (retransmission), UDP (drop) |

---

## üîπ Bufferbloat

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**Bufferbloat** is the excessive delay caused by **large network buffers** holding too many packets during congestion.

---

### ‚úÖ Cause:

- Buffers in routers/switches are too deep.
- Instead of dropping packets, they queue them, causing **high latency**.

---

### ‚úÖ Effects:

- Increased ping times
- Lag in interactive apps (e.g., Zoom, gaming)
- TCP sees no packet loss ‚Üí doesn't trigger congestion control

---

### ‚úÖ Detection:

```bash
$ ping -f google.com
‚Üí Watch for increasing delay under load
```

---

### ‚úÖ Solution:

- **Smaller buffers**
- **Active Queue Management (AQM)**: e.g., RED, CoDel

---

## üîπ RED (Random Early Detection)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Preemptively drops packets to **signal congestion** before buffers overflow.

---

### ‚úÖ How RED Works:

1. Monitors **average queue size**
2. If below minimum threshold ‚Üí accept all packets
3. If between min & max ‚Üí **drop packets probabilistically**
4. If above max threshold ‚Üí **drop all packets**

---

### ‚úÖ RED vs Tail Drop:

| Feature       | Tail Drop             | RED                       |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Drop Timing   | Only when buffer full | Before buffer overflows   |
| Drop Behavior | Sudden                | Gradual, probabilistic    |
| TCP Reaction  | All flows affected    | Spreads loss across flows |

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

- Reduces global synchronization of TCP flows
- Prevents bufferbloat
- Encourages early congestion control

---

## üîπ Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)

### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Allows routers to **signal congestion without dropping packets**.

---

### ‚úÖ How It Works:

1. Routers mark packets with **ECN bits** in IP header if congestion is detected.
2. Receiver echoes ECN mark back to sender.
3. Sender reduces congestion window as if a packet loss occurred.

---

### ‚úÖ ECN Bits in IP Header:

| ECN Bits | Meaning                     |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| 00       | Not ECN Capable             |
| 10       | ECN Capable                 |
| 11       | Congestion Experienced (CE) |

---

### ‚úÖ Requirements:

- Both sender and receiver must **support ECN**
- Supported in **TCP/IP stack and routers**

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

- Maintains throughput
- Avoids packet loss
- Works well with RED

---

## üîπ Real-world Q&A

**Q1:** Why is jitter more critical than latency for VoIP?

- Even if packets are delayed, consistent delay is tolerable ‚Üí **variation causes audio breaks**

**Q2:** Why is RED preferred over tail drop?

- Prevents **queue buildup** and global synchronization in TCP flows

**Q3:** What makes bufferbloat hard to detect?

- No packet drops ‚Üí TCP doesn't slow down ‚Üí only visible as latency increase

**Q4:** Why does ECN require end-to-end support?

- Sender must understand ECN flags and reduce congestion window accordingly

**Q5:** How do RED and ECN work together?

- RED detects congestion ‚Üí ECN marks instead of dropping ‚Üí TCP reduces rate smoothly

## üîπ Latency Optimization Techniques

Modern networks use a variety of techniques to **minimize latency** and improve user experience, especially for web and mobile applications.

---

### ‚úÖ HTTP/2 Server Push

- Allows the server to **proactively send resources** (like CSS/JS) to the client before it‚Äôs requested.

```http
HTTP/2 PUSH: style.css, script.js
```

> ‚ùó Misuse can increase bandwidth and cache duplication if not handled carefully.

---

### ‚úÖ TCP Fast Open (TFO)

- Enables **data transfer to begin during the handshake** instead of waiting for it to complete.

1. SYN ‚Üí
2. SYN-ACK ‚Üê
3. ACK ‚Üí
4. THEN send data

#### TCP Fast Open:

- Data sent **with SYN**, reducing one RTT

```bash
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen=3  # Enable client/server support
```

---
