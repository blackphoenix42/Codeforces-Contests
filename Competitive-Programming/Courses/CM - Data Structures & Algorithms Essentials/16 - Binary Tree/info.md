- Heirarchical Data Structure
- Special kind tree where each nodes has atmost 2 children
- **Siblings:** Have same parents
- **Leaf Node: ** Which doesnt have any children. Ex: 7th Node
- **Height:** Total Number of levels is height of tree. Ex: Total Height = 4
- **Depth:** Its specific for a node lets say. Ex: 4th Node has depth of 3

## PreOrder

Root -> Left -> Right

## InOrder

Left -> Root -> Right

## PostOrder

Left -> Right -> Root

- Most used traversal
- Bottom up traversal

## Level Order

- Use queue (FIFO)

## Diameter of Tree

- The distance between any two nodes of a tree
- It may or may not pass through subtree


## Search in Binary Tree

- O (N)
