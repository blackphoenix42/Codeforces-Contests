# Binary Search Tree

- It is a binary tree means each node has at most two children
- All nodes in left should have value <= root
- All nodes in right should have value >= root
- BST follows a recursive structure

## Inorder Traversal

- Left -> Root -> Right
- Inorder Traversal of BST will always be sorted


## Searching in BST

- O(Height of Tree)     
- Min O(logn) <= Avg O(H) <= Worst O(N)
-
