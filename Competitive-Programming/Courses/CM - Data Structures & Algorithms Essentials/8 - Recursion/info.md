## Recursion

- Recusrion in Coccmputer Science is a technique where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

## Principal of Mathematical Induction

1. Figure of the smallest case
2. Always **Assume** the subproblem can be solved
3. solve the current problem assuming subproblem solution exists
