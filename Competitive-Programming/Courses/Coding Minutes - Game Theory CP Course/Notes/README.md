# Combinatorial Games

They are two peron games with perfect information and no chance moves and with a win or lose outcome.

- Two persons playing the game Ex: Alice and Bob ( A & B)
- We assume both of them are supercomputers that means they play optimally
- They play alternatively
- There are finite set of positions & moves.

## Impartial Games & Partizan Games

**Impartial Games:** In which set of moves available from any give position is the same for both players.

**Partizan Games:** In which each player has a different set of possible moves from a given position.

## Normal or Misere Rule for any game

**Terminal Position:** When a player is not able to make a move from that position

**Normal Game -** Last player to make a move wins. Like Alice made a move and bob is now unable to make a move so Alice wins.

**Misere Rule -** The last player to make a move loses.

# Take Away Game

Example:

- Alice & Bob playing alternatively
- They are n stones in a pile
- In 1 move they can pick 1,2 or 3 stones from a pile
- Alice moves first
- Last player to make a move loses
