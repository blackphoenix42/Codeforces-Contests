Purpose:

Implementation of Trie has been asked in my interviews like in Google
Store word in Dictionary
Search word in the dictionary returns True if exist
Stores words in a compressed manner

Inputs:
1nd line no of word you want to store in Trie (int)
2rd line to (2+1st line input)th line (string)
Next line enter number of words want to search
